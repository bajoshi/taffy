# to run lzifu and idl
# in all the notes below, OBJ is the object name as identified by 
# the 'obj_name' parameter in the lzifu_OBJ.pro file.
# also check the notes by Phil (called useful.txt) with more details 
# in the .../phil/ folder in the external hard drive.

0. make sure that you have the correct directory structure to
run lzifu in place. You need to have the 3 folders in whatever path 
the code points to... i.e. you should have the data, products, and scripts 
folders; with data -- contains both red and blue cubes as OBJ_B.fits and OBJ_R.fits,
products -- should be empty, and scripts -- should contain the scripts lzifu_OBJ.pro
and lzifu_linelist_OBJ.pro

1. first edit lzifu_loop_spaxel.pro if you need to run it
only on some pixels or on all of them.

2. # at the terminal
>> startlzifuv1.0
>> cd /path/to/idl_scripts_for_OBJ
>> idl

idl>> .r lzifu_OBJ.pro
idl>> lzifu_OBJ  # this will run the code # no .pro
